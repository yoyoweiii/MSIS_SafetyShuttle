# MSIS_SafetyShuttle
This project is an idea to improve Auburn University safety shuttle's quality.
safety shuttle is a service provided by  Department of Campus Safety and Security in Auburn University that operates between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. and transports passengers to on-campus locations only. Any student or staff can call (334) 844-7400 and speak with the dispatcher to request a pickup or use the Auburn Safety app's chat request feature.
The goal of this project is looking for an improvement to provide more information in order to increase security level.
